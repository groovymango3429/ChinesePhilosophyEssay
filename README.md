## Essay Thesis

Unlike Western divine right's ex ante sacralization of rule, Mencian tianming is conditional and performance-based: the people's welfare and moral sentiments (minxin) function as Heaven's barometer, legitimating removal of tyrants. Secularizing "Heaven" into auditable public goods and coupling it with explicit popular consent yields a two-key legitimacy model—Revocable Mandate Constitutionalism—that reconciles Confucian graded love with equal citizenship and resolves the Analects/Mencius tensions between family loyalty and public law.

## Key Concepts

- **Tianming (天命)**: Mandate of Heaven - conditional authorization to rule
- **Minxin (民心)**: People's hearts-and-minds - the empirical measure of Heaven's approval
- **Tian Li (天理)**: Heavenly principle - moral/cosmic order
- **Guo Fa (国法)**: Positive law - enacted statutes
- **Graded Love**: Confucian ethical structure where affection diminishes concentrically from family outward
- **Revocable Mandate Constitutionalism (RMC)**: The proposed two-key legitimacy model combining performance metrics with popular consent
