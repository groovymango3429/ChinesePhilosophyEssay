## Topic 1: Ritual and Reciprocity as Foundation of Social Order

**Thesis**: While Western social contract theory grounds political obligation in rational consent and individual rights, Confucius's Analects establishes social order through ritual propriety (li 礼) and reciprocity (shu 恕), demonstrating that harmonious society emerges not from abstract universal principles but from cultivated behavioral patterns that transform self-interest into mutual care, making ritual the performative infrastructure of virtue rather than mere ceremonial formality.

**Key concepts to explore**:
- Ritual (li) as embodied ethics vs. abstract moral rules
- Reciprocity (shu) as the practice of extending oneself to understand others
- Music and ritual as civilizing forces
- Comparison with Western social contract models (Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau)
- How ritual creates "second nature" that bridges individual and collective good

**Relevant passages**:
- Analects 1:2 on filial piety as root of ren
- Analects 12:2 on reciprocity ("Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire")
- Analects 15:24 on shu as the "single thread" running through Confucius's teachings

## Topic 2: Natural Equality vs. Moral Hierarchy in Mencian Philosophy

**Thesis**: Mencius's doctrine of innate human goodness (the "four beginnings") establishes natural moral equality across all humans, yet his political philosophy prescribes hierarchical governance and graded affection, revealing a productive tension wherein universal moral capacity grounds the legitimacy of differentiated social roles—rulers and ruled share the same moral nature, but governance structures reflect cultivated virtue rather than birth status, offering an alternative to both Western egalitarianism and caste-based stratification.

**Key concepts to explore**:
- The four beginnings (compassion, shame, deference, moral discrimination)
- Human commonality and natural equality vs. achieved virtue
- Extension (tui 推) from family to broader society
- Humane government as accountability mechanism
- Comparison with Western equality doctrine and meritocracy

**Relevant passages**:
- Mencius 2A:6 on the four beginnings of virtue
- Mencius 1A:7 on extending care to others' elders and young
- Mencius 6A:6 on human nature being good like water flowing downward

## Topic 3: The Mandate of Heaven as Performance-Based Legitimacy

**Thesis**: Unlike Western divine right monarchy where God's authorization is non-revocable and precedes governance, the Mencian Mandate of Heaven (tianming 天命) is conditional, retrospective, and people-centered: Heaven "sees" and "hears" through the populace, making the ruler's legitimacy dependent on demonstrable welfare provision and moral governance, thus anticipating modern performance legitimacy while avoiding both theocratic absolutism and unconstrained popular sovereignty through its dual accountability to transcendent principle and empirical outcomes.

**Key concepts to explore**:
- Tianming as revocable cosmic authorization
- People's hearts-and-minds (minxin 民心) as Heaven's barometer
- Legitimacy of revolution against tyrants (King Wu's overthrow)
- Comparison with Western divine right (James I, Filmer)
- Modern relevance for authoritarian vs. democratic legitimacy debates

**Relevant passages**:
- Mencius 1B:8 on King Wu punishing "a mere fellow," not regicide
- Mencius 5A:5 "Heaven sees as my people see; Heaven hears as my people hear"
- Contrast with Biblical Romans 13:1 on divinely appointed authority

## Topic 4: The Use of the Useless: Zhuangzi's Critique of Instrumental Rationality

**Thesis**: Against the Confucian valorization of social utility and the Legalist emphasis on state efficiency, Zhuangzi's parables of "useless" trees and "crippled" sages subvert instrumental rationality itself, arguing that survival and flourishing paradoxically depend on escaping the categorical schemes that render beings exploitable; this radical perspectivalism critiques not just particular social hierarchies but the very logic of utility maximization, offering resources for contemporary ecological and anti-capitalist thought that resists reducing all value to function.

**Key concepts to explore**:
- The useless tree that survives because it cannot be harvested
- "The years that Heaven gave" and natural lifespan
- Caring for life through non-interference (wu wei)
- Critique of Confucian and Mohist instrumentalism
- Relevance to modern efficiency culture and environmental ethics

**Relevant passages**:
- Zhuangzi's parable of the gnarled tree (Chapter 4)
- The story of the hunchback cicada catcher
- "Fish trap" passage on forgetting words after catching meaning

## Topic 5: Suffering, Karma, and Liberation in Buddhist Thought

**Thesis**: The Buddha's doctrine that "life is suffering" (dukkha) is not pessimistic nihilism but diagnostic realism: by tracing suffering to craving and ignorance (the Second Noble Truth), Buddhist philosophy reframes the human condition as curable rather than tragic, with the middle way of meditation offering a practical path to Nirvana that transcends both ascetic self-mortification and hedonistic indulgence, thereby proposing enlightenment as the cessation of cyclical rebirth (samsara) rather than union with a creator deity—a soteriological model fundamentally distinct from Abrahamic salvation.

**Key concepts to explore**:
- Four Noble Truths: suffering, origin, cessation, path
- Karma and rebirth (samsara) vs. Christian linear time and judgment
- Nirvana as extinction of craving, not eternal afterlife
- The middle way between extremes
- Comparison with Christian salvation through grace and faith

**Relevant passages**:
- The Buddha's first sermon (Turning the Wheel of Dharma)
- The Buddha's reflections before enlightenment (pages 49-51 in text)
- Distinction between Theravada and Mahayana classifications

## Topic 6: Accommodation vs. Inculturation in Jesuit Mission Strategy

**Thesis**: Matteo Ricci's "accommodation" strategy—adopting Confucian terminology (Shangdi as "Lord on High"), permitting ancestor rites, and presenting Christianity as completion of Chinese wisdom—successfully penetrated elite Chinese culture but ultimately faced Vatican condemnation in the Rites Controversy, revealing the tension between tactical flexibility and doctrinal integrity; the shift from accommodation to "inculturation" represents a deeper theological move wherein Christianity seeks not merely strategic adaptation but genuine mutual transformation with local traditions, raising unresolved questions about religious universalism versus cultural particularity.

**Key concepts to explore**:
- Matteo Ricci's cultural adaptation methods
- Adam Schall von Bell's astronomical contributions and political influence
- Li Zhizao's strategy of introducing Christianity as compatible with Confucianism
- The Rites Controversy and papal bulls condemning accommodation
- Modern inculturation theology and interreligious dialogue

**Relevant historical moments**:
- Ricci's use of Confucian classics to support Christian theology
- Scientific knowledge as bridge (calendar reform, artillery)
- Kangxi Emperor's edict permitting Christianity (1692)
- Papal condemnation (1715, 1742) and imperial ban

## Topic 7: Family Love and Moral Extension in Confucian Ethics

**Thesis**: Confucianism's graded love (ai 爱)—beginning with intense familial affection and diminishing concentrically outward—rejects both Christian agape's undifferentiated universal love and utilitarian impartiality, instead grounding ethics in psychological realism about human attachment; however, the mechanism of "extension" (tui 推) from family to strangers remains institutionally underspecified, creating a persistent vulnerability to nepotism and partiality that can only be resolved through constitutional guardrails (transparency, conflict-of-interest rules, anti-nepotism statutes) that honor family warmth while preventing its corruption of public impartiality.

**Key concepts to explore**:
- Graded affection vs. universal impartial love
- Extension (tui) as moral-psychological process
- Family as root of virtue (xiao, ti)
- The problem of partiality in governance
- Institutional solutions: recusal rules, testimonial privileges, equal protection

**Relevant passages**:
- Analects 1:2 on filial piety as root of ren
- Mencius 1A:7 on extending care concentrically
- Analects 13:18 on father-son mutual concealment
- Mencius 7A:35 on Shun's dilemma with criminal father

## Topic 8: Confucian Reciprocity vs. Christian Self-Sacrifice

**Thesis**: Confucius's reciprocity (shu 恕)—"do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire"—operates through empathetic projection and mutual recognition, preserving the self as an irreducible moral agent, whereas Jesus's command to "love your enemies" and "turn the other cheek" demands asymmetrical self-sacrifice that transcends reciprocity entirely; this contrast reveals divergent anthropologies—Confucianism presumes ethical relationships among socially embedded persons, Christianity posits radical individual discipleship answerable to God alone—with profound implications for justice, forgiveness, and the boundaries of moral obligation.

**Key concepts to explore**:
- Shu (reciprocity) as negative and positive golden rule
- Christian agape as non-reciprocal love
- Jesus's commands to love enemies, turn the other cheek (Matthew 5)
- Limits of reciprocity: when does it fail?
- Role of transcendence in grounding self-sacrifice

**Relevant passages**:
- Analects 15:24 on shu as Confucius's guiding principle
- Analects 12:2 defining reciprocity
- Matthew 5:38-48 (Sermon on the Mount)
- Luke 14:26 on hating family for discipleship

## Topic 9: The Stance Toward Death and Spirits in Confucian Philosophy

**Thesis**: Confucius's famous evasion—"Not yet understanding life, how can we understand death?" (Analects 11:12) and "Respect ghosts and spirits but keep them at a distance" (6:22)—is not agnostic evasion but strategic prioritization: by bracketing metaphysical speculation about the afterlife, Confucianism directs ethical energy toward this-worldly relationships and ritual correctness, implicitly proposing that meaning and transcendence arise through social continuity (ancestor veneration, ritual transmission) rather than supernatural salvation, thereby offering a secular humanistic alternative to both theistic religion and materialist nihilism.

**Key concepts to explore**:
- Confucian focus on life rather than afterlife
- Ancestor veneration as social memory, not theology
- Ritual as this-worldly transcendence
- Comparison with Buddhist rebirth and Christian resurrection
- Secular humanism and Confucian continuity

**Relevant passages**:
- Analects 11:12 "Not yet understanding life..."
- Analects 6:22 on spirits
- Analects 3:12 on sacrificing to ancestors
- Contrast with Buddhist karma-rebirth and Christian eternal life

## Topic 10: Lin Zexu's Letter to Queen Victoria: Moral Suasion vs. Imperial Power

**Thesis**: Commissioner Lin Zexu's 1839 letter to Queen Victoria, invoking universal moral principles ("Where is your conscience?") and the reciprocal obligations of the Mandate of Heaven to condemn Britain's opium trade, represents Confucian moral suasion confronting Western imperial realpolitik; its rhetorical power lies in appealing to shared humanistic values (life preservation, sovereign duty), yet its tragic inefficacy reveals the limitations of moral argument when facing asymmetric military and economic power, crystallizing the tension between ethics and force in international relations and foreshadowing the century of humiliation that followed China's failure to reconcile Confucian universalism with Western gunboat diplomacy.

**Key concepts to explore**:
- Confucian moral universalism (tianxia, "all under heaven")
- Mandate of Heaven as mutual obligation (rulers protect subjects)
- Moral suasion as diplomatic strategy
- Opium War as clash of civilizations
- Limits of ethics in power politics

**Strengths of Lin's letter**:
- Appeals to universal moral principles
- Exposes hypocrisy (Britain bans opium domestically)
- Invokes reciprocity and cosmic justice

**Weaknesses**:
- Assumes shared moral framework
- Underestimates British imperial interests
- Lacks credible enforcement mechanism
